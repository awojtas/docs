# Automatic rotation

Automatic rotation allows turns to advance on a schedule without manual action. Perfect for recurring chores, weekly responsibilities, or any activity with a regular cadence.

## How it works

When automatic rotation is enabled:
- Turns advance automatically at the scheduled time
- Participants receive notifications when it becomes their turn
- The activity card shows a countdown to the next rotation
- Turn history records automatic rotations separately from manual completions

## Setting up automatic rotation

### For new activities

1. Click **New Activity**
2. Fill in the activity details
3. Under **Rotation Mode**, select **Automatic**
4. Configure the schedule:
   - **Frequency**: Daily, Weekly, Fortnightly, or Monthly
   - **Day of week**: For weekly/fortnightly schedules
   - **Time of day**: When the turn should rotate (24-hour format)
5. Click **Create Activity**

### For existing activities

1. Open the activity
2. Click **Edit**
3. Change **Rotation Mode** to **Automatic**
4. Configure the schedule
5. Click **Save**

## Frequency options

### Daily
Turns rotate every day at the specified time.

**Example**: Dishes rotate at 8:00 PM every evening.

### Weekly
Turns rotate once per week on a specific day.

**Example**: Trash duty rotates every Monday at 7:00 AM.

### Fortnightly
Turns rotate every two weeks on a specific day.

**Example**: Deep cleaning rotates every other Saturday at 10:00 AM.

### Monthly
Turns rotate once per month on the same day.

**Example**: Bill payment rotates on the 1st of each month at 9:00 AM.

## Visual indicators

Activities with automatic rotation display:
- **AUTO badge**: Shows the activity uses automatic rotation
- **Countdown timer**: Time remaining until next rotation
- **Purple gradient**: Activity cards have a purple/cyan gradient

## Combining with other features

### With due dates
Set a due date that matches your rotation schedule. The due date will automatically advance when turns rotate.

### With rewards
Rewards are awarded when turns rotate automatically, just like manual completions.

### With skip rules
Skip rules still apply. Participants can skip their turn before the automatic rotation if allowed.

## Switching back to manual

To disable automatic rotation:

1. Edit the activity
2. Change **Rotation Mode** to **Manual**
3. Click **Save**

The turn history is preserved, and the activity continues with manual turn tracking.

## Best practices

- **Match frequency to activity**: Use daily for everyday tasks, weekly for regular chores
- **Set convenient times**: Choose times when participants are typically available
- **Communicate with participants**: Let everyone know when automatic rotation is enabled
- **Test the schedule**: Create a test activity to verify the timing works for your group

## Troubleshooting

### Turns aren't rotating
- Check that the activity is not archived
- Verify the next rotation time hasn't passed
- Ensure all participants are still active

### Wrong rotation time
- Edit the activity and update the time of day
- The next rotation will use the new schedule
