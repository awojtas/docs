# Frequently asked questions

Quick answers to common questions.

## General

### What is Turnsies?

Yes.

### Do I need an account?

Yes. Accounts sync your activities across devices.

## Activities

### How many activities can I create?

Unlimited.

### What happens if I delete an activity?

It's gone forever. All history deleted.

### Can I restore an archived activity?

Yes. Go to Archive, open the activity, and restore it.

## Participants

### What's the difference between local and invited participants?

**Local**: Names you type. Only you see them. No account needed.  
**Invited**: Registered users who get an email and can access the activity.

### Can I remove a participant?

Yes. Edit the activity and remove them. History is preserved. If you're a participant, use Leave Activity from the menu.

### How do participant groups work?

Save groups of people. Reuse them across activities. Create once, add with one click.

### What are admin permissions?

Admins can edit settings, manage participants, complete turns for others, and delete activities. Marked with a shield icon.

### Can I exclude someone from rotation without removing them?

Yes. Mark them as "not participating." They stay in the activity but don't appear in rotation or earn rewards.

## Turn tracking

### How does turn rotation work?

**Manual**: Someone clicks Done to advance.  
**Automatic**: Turns advance on schedule (daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly).

### Can I skip someone's turn?

Depends on skip rules. Configure to allow everyone, own turns only, or no skips.

### Can I undo a turn?

Yes. Undo from the three-dot menu within a few minutes of completion.

### What is "Done by me"?

Did the activity when it wasn't your turn? Use Done by me. You get credit, rotation continues normally.

### How does automatic rotation work?

Set a schedule and time. Turns advance automatically. See the [Automatic rotation guide](/web/automatic-rotation).

## Account

### How do I change my email?

Go to **Settings** → **Profile** → **Email** and update your email address. You'll need to verify the new email.

### How do I delete my account?

Go to **Settings** → **Account** → **Delete Account**. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

### Can I export my data?

Yes, go to **Settings** → **Data** → **Export Data**. You'll receive an email with a download link.

## Rewards

### How does the rewards system work?

You can configure activities to award money or points when participants complete turns. Balances accumulate over time, and activity owners can record payouts when rewards are redeemed. See the [Rewards guide](/web/rewards) for details.

### What currencies are supported?

Money rewards support USD, NZD, AUD, and GBP. Amounts are stored in cents/pence for precision.

### Can I change reward values after creating an activity?

Yes, you can edit the reward configuration at any time. Changes apply to future turns only—previous balances are not affected.

### What happens to rewards if I disable them?

Existing balances and payout history are preserved. If you re-enable rewards later, previous balances will still be there.

## Technical

### Does Turnsies work offline?

The web app requires an internet connection. The mobile app (coming soon) will cache activities for offline access, with changes syncing when you're back online.

### Why isn't my data syncing?

Check that:
- You're signed in to the same account on all devices
- You have an internet connection
- You're using the latest version of the app

Try signing out and back in if issues persist.
