# Frequently asked questions

Find answers to common questions about Turnsies.

## General

### What is Turnsies?

Turnsies is a turn-tracking application that helps you manage shared responsibilities and activities with friends, family, or colleagues.

### Is Turnsies free?

Yes, Turnsies is currently free to use on both web and mobile.

### Do I need an account?

Yes, you need to create an account to use Turnsies. This allows your activities to sync across devices.

## Activities

### How many activities can I create?

There's no limit to the number of activities you can create.

### Can I share activities with others?

Yes, you can invite other Turnsies users to your activities. They'll receive an email invitation.

### What happens if I delete an activity?

Deleting an activity is permanent. All turn history and participant data for that activity will be deleted.

### Can I restore an archived activity?

Yes, go to the Archive section, open the activity, and click **Restore**.

## Participants

### What's the difference between local and invited participants?

- **Local participants**: Names you add manually. Only visible to you. They don't need a Turnsies account.
- **Invited participants**: Registered Turnsies users who receive an email invitation and can access and update the activity.

### Can I remove a participant?

Yes, edit the activity and remove the participant. Their turn history will be preserved. If you're a participant (not the owner), you can leave the activity from the menu.

### How do participant groups work?

Groups let you quickly add the same set of people to multiple activities. Create a group once, then add all members with one click when creating or editing activities.

### What are admin permissions?

Admins can edit activity settings, add/remove participants, complete turns on behalf of others, and archive/delete the activity. Activity owners can designate any participant as an admin.

### Can I exclude someone from rotation without removing them?

Yes, you can mark a participant as "not participating." They'll remain in the activity (and keep admin rights if they had them) but won't appear in the turn rotation or earn rewards.

## Turn tracking

### How does turn rotation work?

Turnsies supports two rotation modes:
- **Manual**: Participants manually mark turns as complete
- **Automatic**: Turns rotate automatically on a schedule (daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly)

### Can I skip someone's turn?

Yes, if skip rules allow it. Activities can be configured with three skip rule options:
- **Everyone**: Any participant can skip any turn
- **Own turns only**: Participants can only skip their own turns
- **No skips**: Skipping is disabled

### Can I undo a turn?

Yes, you can undo the most recent turn if it was completed within the last few minutes. Click the menu (three dots) and select **Undo**.

### What is "Done by me"?

If you complete an activity when it's not your turn, use "Done by me" from the menu. This records that you did the activity while keeping the turn order intact.

### How does automatic rotation work?

With automatic rotation, turns advance on a schedule without manual action. You can set activities to rotate daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly at a specific time. See the [Automatic rotation guide](/web/automatic-rotation) for details.

## Account

### How do I change my email?

Go to **Settings** → **Profile** → **Email** and update your email address. You'll need to verify the new email.

### How do I delete my account?

Go to **Settings** → **Account** → **Delete Account**. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

### Can I export my data?

Yes, go to **Settings** → **Data** → **Export Data**. You'll receive an email with a download link.

## Rewards

### How does the rewards system work?

You can configure activities to award money or points when participants complete turns. Balances accumulate over time, and activity owners can record payouts when rewards are redeemed. See the [Rewards guide](/web/rewards) for details.

### What currencies are supported?

Money rewards support USD, NZD, AUD, and GBP. Amounts are stored in cents/pence for precision.

### Can I change reward values after creating an activity?

Yes, you can edit the reward configuration at any time. Changes apply to future turns only—previous balances are not affected.

### What happens to rewards if I disable them?

Existing balances and payout history are preserved. If you re-enable rewards later, previous balances will still be there.

## Technical

### Does Turnsies work offline?

The web app requires an internet connection. The mobile app (coming soon) will cache activities for offline access, with changes syncing when you're back online.

### Why isn't my data syncing?

Check that:
- You're signed in to the same account on all devices
- You have an internet connection
- You're using the latest version of the app

Try signing out and back in if issues persist.
