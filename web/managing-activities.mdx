# Managing activities

Learn how to manage your Turnsies activities effectively.

## Editing an activity

2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon)
3. Update any of the following:

   - Participants (add or remove)
   - Activity image

## Rotation modes

Turnsies supports two rotation modes:

3. Choose **Manual** or **Automatic**
4. If automatic, configure the schedule and time

## Archiving activities

Archive activities you no longer need:

1. Open the activity
2. Click **Archive** in the menu
3. Confirm the action

Archived activities are moved to the Archive section and can be restored later.

## Viewing turn history

See who completed turns and when:

1. Open an activity
2. Click **Turn History**
3. View the complete history with timestamps

## Filtering and sorting

On the home screen:

- **Filter**: Show active, archived, or all activities
- **Sort**: By name, last turn, or creation date
- **Search**: Find activities by name

## Deleting an activity

<Warning>
Deleting an activity is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

1. Open the activity
2. Click **Delete** in the menu
3. Confirm the deletion

## Skip rules

Control who can skip turns in an activity:

1. Edit the activity
2. Go to **Skip Rules**
3. Choose from:
   - **Everyone**: Any participant can skip any turn
   - **Own turns only**: Participants can only skip their own turns
   - **No skips**: Skipping is disabled

You can also enable **Only skip when in credit** to require participants to have completed more turns than average before skipping.

## Admin permissions

Designate participants as admins who can:
- Edit activity settings
- Add or remove participants
- Complete turns on behalf of others
- Archive or delete the activity

To make someone an admin:
1. Edit the activity
2. Find the participant
3. Toggle **Admin** status

## Due dates

Set recurring due dates for activities:

1. Edit the activity
2. Enable **Due Date**
3. Set the initial due date
4. Choose recurrence:
   - None (one-time)
   - Daily
   - Weekly
   - Monthly

When a turn is completed, the due date automatically advances based on the recurrence.

## Done by me

If you complete an activity when it's not your turn:

1. Open the activity menu (three dots)
2. Click **Done by me**
3. The turn history records you did it, but the turn order continues normally

This is useful for tracking who actually did the work, even when it wasn't their scheduled turn.

## Leaving an activity

If you're a participant in someone else's activity:

1. Open the activity menu
2. Click **Leave Activity**
3. Confirm

<Note>
If only one participant remains after you leave, the activity will be automatically archived.
