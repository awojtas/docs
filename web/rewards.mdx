# Rewards system

Track money or points earned for completing turns. Perfect for chore allowances or incentivizing participation.

## How it works

Enable rewards on any activity. Set a value per turn (money or points). When someone completes their turn, they earn that amount. Balances accumulate. Activity owners record payouts when rewards are redeemed. Complete history is maintained.

## Reward types

**Money**: Track real currency (USD, NZD, AUD, GBP). Example: $2.50 per dish load.

**Points**: Track a point system. Example: 10 points per chore, redeemable for privileges.

## Setting up rewards

When creating or editing an activity, enable Rewards, choose Money or Points, and set the value per turn. For money, select your currency.

Rewards start tracking from when you enable them. Previous turns don't earn retroactively.

## Viewing balances

Balances appear on the activity card showing current balance, total earned, and total redeemed. Click any participant's balance for details and payout history.

## Recording payouts

Activity owners record payouts when rewards are redeemed. Click a participant's balance, then **Record Payout**. Enter the amount and optional description (e.g., "Paid to savings account"). The balance updates immediately.

Payout history shows every transaction with dates, amounts, and who recorded it.

## Rewards with automatic rotation

Rewards work seamlessly with automatic rotation:
- When turns rotate automatically, rewards are awarded
- Participants earn rewards even if they don't manually click "Done"
- Turn history shows which rewards were earned automatically vs. manually

## Rewards and "Done by me"

When a participant uses "Done by me" to complete an activity outside their turn:
- They earn the reward for that completion
- The turn order continues normally
- This encourages participants to help out even when it's not their turn

## Excluding participants from rewards

Participants can be excluded from turn rotation while remaining in the activity:

1. Edit the activity
2. Find the participant
3. Toggle **Participating** off

Non-participating members:
- Don't appear in the turn rotation
- Don't earn rewards
- Can still view the activity
- Retain admin permissions if they had them

This is useful for parents or supervisors who manage the activity but don't participate.

## Best practices

- **Set fair values**: Ensure reward amounts are appropriate for the effort required
- **Regular payouts**: Record payouts regularly to keep balances manageable
- **Clear communication**: Explain the reward system to all participants
- **Track everything**: Use the payout description field to note how rewards were redeemed

## Currency formatting

Money rewards are automatically formatted based on the selected currency:
- USD: $2.50
- NZD: NZ$2.50
- AUD: A$2.50
- GBP: £2.50

Points are displayed as: "25 points"

## Disabling rewards

To disable rewards on an activity:

1. Edit the activity
2. Set reward type to **None**
3. Click **Save**

<Warning>
Disabling rewards does not delete existing balances or payout history. If you re-enable rewards later, previous balances will still be there.
</Warning>
