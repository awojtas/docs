# Managing activities

Keep your activities organized and up to date.

## Editing an activity

Click the three-dot menu on any activity card, then **Edit**. Change the name, add or remove participants, update the image, or adjust rotation settings. Click **Save** when done.

## Rotation modes

**Manual** (default): Someone clicks "Done" to advance the turn.

**Automatic**: Turns advance on schedule without anyone clicking anything. Set it to rotate daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly at a specific time.

Activities with automatic rotation show an "AUTO" badge and countdown timer.

## Archiving activities

Archive activities you're done with. They move to the Archive section and can be restored anytime. Use the three-dot menu and select **Archive**.

## Turn history

Every activity maintains a complete history of who did what and when. Click **View History** in the three-dot menu to see it.

## Finding activities

Use the search bar to find activities by name. Filter by active or archived. Sort by name, last turn, or creation date.

## Deleting an activity

<Warning>
Deleting an activity is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

1. Open the activity
2. Click **Delete** in the menu
3. Confirm the deletion

## Skip rules

Control who can skip turns:

- **Everyone**: Anyone can skip any turn
- **Own turns only**: You can only skip your own turn
- **No skips**: Skipping is disabled

Enable **Only skip when in credit** to require participants to be ahead of average before they can skip.

## Admin permissions

Admins can edit settings, manage participants, complete turns for others, and archive or delete the activity. Useful when one person needs to manage an activity for a group (like a parent managing kids' chores).

Designate admins when editing an activity. Admins are marked with a shield icon.

## Due dates

Set a due date that recurs daily, weekly, or monthly. When someone completes their turn, the due date automatically advances. Overdue activities are highlighted in red.

## Done by me

Did the dishes even though it wasn't your turn? Use **Done by me** from the three-dot menu. You get credit in the history, but the turn rotation continues normally. Perfect for tracking who actually does the work.

## Leaving an activity

If you're in someone else's activity and want out, use **Leave Activity** from the three-dot menu. If you're the last person, the activity archives automatically.
