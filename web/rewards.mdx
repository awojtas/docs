# Rewards system

Track money or points earned for completing turns. Perfect for chore allowances or incentivizing participation.

## How it works

Enable rewards on any activity. Set a value per turn (money or points). When someone completes their turn, they earn that amount. Balances accumulate. Activity owners record payouts when rewards are redeemed. Complete history is maintained.

## Reward types

**Money**: Track real currency (USD, NZD, AUD, GBP). Example: $2.50 per dish load.

**Points**: Track a point system. Example: 10 points per chore, redeemable for privileges.

## Setting up rewards

When creating or editing an activity, enable Rewards, choose Money or Points, and set the value per turn. For money, select your currency.

Rewards start tracking from when you enable them. Previous turns don't earn retroactively.

## Viewing balances

Balances appear on the activity card showing current balance, total earned, and total redeemed. Click any participant's balance for details and payout history.

## Recording payouts

Activity owners record payouts when rewards are redeemed. Click a participant's balance, then **Record Payout**. Enter the amount and optional description (e.g., "Paid to savings account"). The balance updates immediately.

Payout history shows every transaction with dates, amounts, and who recorded it.

## Rewards with automatic rotation

Participants earn rewards when turns rotate automatically. No manual action needed.

## Rewards and "Done by me"

Use "Done by me" to complete an activity outside your turn? You still earn the reward. This encourages helping out even when it's not your turn.

## Excluding participants

Parents or supervisors can be in an activity without participating in the rotation. Toggle **Participating** off when editing. They can still view and manage the activity but won't earn rewards or appear in the turn order.

## Disabling rewards

Set reward type to None when editing. Existing balances and history are preserved if you re-enable later.
