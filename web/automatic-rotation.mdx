# Automatic rotation

Set it once, forget about it. Turns advance on schedule without anyone clicking anything.

## How it works

Pick a schedule (daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly) and a time. Turnsies advances the turn automatically. The activity card shows a countdown timer and an "AUTO" badge. Turn history tracks which rotations were automatic vs. manual.

## Setting up automatic rotation

When creating or editing an activity, select **Automatic** under Rotation Mode. Choose your frequency, day (for weekly/fortnightly), and time. That's it.

## Frequency options

**Daily**: Rotates every day at the same time (e.g., dishes at 8 PM)

**Weekly**: Rotates once per week on a specific day (e.g., trash every Monday at 7 AM)

**Fortnightly**: Rotates every two weeks (e.g., deep cleaning every other Saturday)

**Monthly**: Rotates once per month on the same day (e.g., bills on the 1st at 9 AM)

## Combining with other features

### With due dates
Set a due date that matches your rotation schedule. The due date will automatically advance when turns rotate.

### With rewards
Rewards are awarded when turns rotate automatically, just like manual completions.

### With skip rules
Skip rules still apply. Participants can skip their turn before the automatic rotation if allowed.

## Switching back to manual

To disable automatic rotation:

1. Edit the activity
2. Change **Rotation Mode** to **Manual**
3. Click **Save**

The turn history is preserved, and the activity continues with manual turn tracking.

## Best practices

- **Match frequency to activity**: Use daily for everyday tasks, weekly for regular chores
- **Set convenient times**: Choose times when participants are typically available
- **Communicate with participants**: Let everyone know when automatic rotation is enabled
- **Test the schedule**: Create a test activity to verify the timing works for your group

## Troubleshooting

### Turns aren't rotating
- Check that the activity is not archived
- Verify the next rotation time hasn't passed
- Ensure all participants are still active

### Wrong rotation time
- Edit the activity and update the time of day
- The next rotation will use the new schedule
