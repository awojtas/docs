# Inviting users

Share activities with other Turnsies users. Changes sync in real-time for everyone.

## How invitations work

Send an invitation via email. They accept or decline. Once accepted, they see the activity on their home screen and can view, edit, and complete turns. Everything syncs instantly.

## Sending an invitation

Open any activity, click **Invite Participant**, enter their email, and send. They'll get an email with an acceptance link.

Pending invitations show on the activity card with an amber badge.

## Accepting invitations

Click the link in the email, sign in (or create an account), review the activity, and accept or decline.

## Permissions

All participants have equal access. Everyone can view history, complete turns, edit settings, and manage participants. Use admin permissions if you need one person to have more control.

## Blocking users

Getting unwanted invitations? Click **Block Sender** when viewing an invitation. Unblock anytime in Settings.
