# Automatic rotation

Set it once, forget about it. Turns advance on schedule without anyone clicking anything.

## How it works

Pick a schedule (daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly) and a time. Turnsies advances the turn automatically. The activity card shows a countdown timer and an "AUTO" badge. Turn history tracks which rotations were automatic vs. manual.

## Setting up automatic rotation

When creating or editing an activity, select **Automatic** under Rotation Mode. Choose your frequency, day (for weekly/fortnightly), and time. That's it.

## Frequency options

**Daily**: Rotates every day at the same time (e.g., dishes at 8 PM)

**Weekly**: Rotates once per week on a specific day (e.g., trash every Monday at 7 AM)

**Fortnightly**: Rotates every two weeks (e.g., deep cleaning every other Saturday)

**Monthly**: Rotates once per month on the same day (e.g., bills on the 1st at 9 AM)

## Works with everything

Automatic rotation works with rewards (participants earn automatically), due dates (advance on schedule), and skip rules (still apply before rotation).

## Switching back to manual

Edit the activity and change Rotation Mode to Manual. History is preserved.
