Save groups of people. Reuse them across activities. Create once, add with one click.

### What are admin permissions?

Admins can edit settings, manage participants, complete turns for others, and delete activities. Marked with a shield icon.

### Can I exclude someone from rotation without removing them?

## Turn tracking

### How does turn rotation work?

**Manual**: Someone clicks Done to advance.  
**Automatic**: Turns advance on schedule (daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly).

### Can I skip someone's turn?

Depends on skip rules. Configure to allow everyone, own turns only, or no skips.

### Can I undo a turn?

Yes. Undo from the three-dot menu within a few minutes of completion.

### What is "Done by me"?

Did the activity when it wasn't your turn? Use Done by me. You get credit, rotation continues normally.

### How does automatic rotation work?

Set a schedule and time. Turns advance automatically. See the [Automatic rotation guide](/web/automatic-rotation).

## Technical

### Does Turnsies work offline?

The web app requires an internet connection. The mobile app (coming soon) will cache activities for offline access, with changes syncing when you're back online.

### Why isn't my data syncing?

Check that:

Try signing out and back in if issues persist.
