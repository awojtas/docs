# Participant groups

Participant groups let you quickly add the same set of people to multiple activities.

## Creating a group

1. Go to **Groups** in the navigation menu
2. Click **New Group**
3. Enter a group name (e.g., "Family", "Roommates", "Work Team")
4. Add participants to the group
5. Click **Save**

## Using groups

When creating or editing an activity:

1. Click **Add from Group**
2. Select a group
3. All group members are added as participants

## Managing groups

### Edit a group

1. Go to **Groups**
2. Click on a group to open it
3. Click **Edit**
4. Add or remove participants
5. Click **Save**

### Delete a group

1. Go to **Groups**
2. Click on a group
3. Click **Delete**

## Best practices

- Create groups for recurring sets of participants
- Use descriptive names (e.g., "Apartment 3B" instead of "Group 1")
- Keep groups updated when people join or leave
