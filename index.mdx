# Welcome to Turnsies

Stop arguing about whose turn it is. Turnsies tracks shared responsibilities so you can focus on what matters.

## What is Turnsies?

Turnsies eliminates the mental load of tracking who did what. Whether you're splitting household chores with roommates, managing family responsibilities, or coordinating team duties, Turnsies keeps everyone accountable without the awkward conversations.

## What you can do

**Track any shared activity**  
From dishes to dog walking, coffee runs to bill payments. If it's something people take turns doing, Turnsies tracks it.

**Set it and forget it**  
Enable automatic rotation for recurring tasks. Turns advance on schedule—daily, weekly, or monthly—without anyone lifting a finger.

**Make it fair**  
See complete history of who did what and when. No more "I did it last time" debates.

**Reward participation**  
Track money or points for completed turns. Perfect for chore allowances or incentivizing kids.

**Collaborate seamlessly**  
Invite others via email. Changes sync instantly across all devices. Everyone sees the same information in real-time.

**Stay flexible**  
Configure skip rules, set due dates, designate admins, and organize participants into reusable groups.
