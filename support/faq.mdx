## Turn tracking

### How does turn rotation work?

Turnsies supports two rotation modes:
- **Manual**: Participants manually mark turns as complete
- **Automatic**: Turns rotate automatically on a schedule (daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly)

### Can I skip someone's turn?

Yes, if skip rules allow it. Activities can be configured with three skip rule options:
- **Everyone**: Any participant can skip any turn
- **Own turns only**: Participants can only skip their own turns
- **No skips**: Skipping is disabled

### Can I undo a turn?

Yes, you can undo the most recent turn if it was completed within the last few minutes. Click the menu (three dots) and select **Undo**.

### What is "Done by me"?

If you complete an activity when it's not your turn, use "Done by me" from the menu. This records that you did the activity while keeping the turn order intact.

### How does automatic rotation work?

With automatic rotation, turns advance on a schedule without manual action. You can set activities to rotate daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly at a specific time. See the [Automatic rotation guide](/web/automatic-rotation) for details.

### Does Turnsies work offline?
