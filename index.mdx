# Welcome to Turnsies

Turnsies tracks whose turn it is for shared activities. Keep everyone on the same page for household chores, team responsibilities, and recurring tasks.

## What is Turnsies?

Turnsies is a turn-tracking application that helps you manage shared responsibilities. Whether you're splitting household chores with roommates, managing family responsibilities, or coordinating team duties, Turnsies maintains a clear record of who does what and when.

## What you can do

**Track any shared activity**  
From dishes to dog walking, coffee runs to bill payments. If it's something people take turns doing, Turnsies tracks it.

**Set it and forget it**  
Enable automatic rotation for recurring tasks. Turns advance on schedule—daily, weekly, or monthly—without anyone lifting a finger.

**View complete history**  
See who did what and when with timestamped turn history.

**Reward participation**  
Track money or points for completed turns. Perfect for chore allowances or incentivizing kids.

**Collaborate seamlessly**  
Invite others via email. Changes sync instantly across all devices. Everyone sees the same information in real-time.

**Stay flexible**  
Configure skip rules, set due dates, designate admins, and organize participants into reusable groups.

## Common scenarios

**Household harmony**  
End the "I always do the dishes" arguments. Track chores, see who's pulling their weight, and keep things fair.

**Splitting costs**  
Remember who paid for coffee last week. No more awkward "you owe me" conversations.

**Parenting made easier**  
Teach kids responsibility with chore tracking and rewards. They see what they've earned, you see what they've done.

**Team coordination**  
Rotate meeting notes, office cleanup, or client coverage. Everyone knows when it's their turn.
