# Welcome to Turnsies

Stop arguing about whose turn it is. Turnsies tracks shared responsibilities so you can focus on what matters.

## What is Turnsies?

Turnsies eliminates the mental load of tracking who did what. Whether you're splitting household chores with roommates, managing family responsibilities, or coordinating team duties, Turnsies keeps everyone accountable without the awkward conversations.

**Set it and forget it**  
Enable automatic rotation for recurring tasks. Turns advance on schedule—daily, weekly, or monthly—without anyone lifting a finger.

**Make it fair**  
See complete history of who did what and when. No more "I did it last time" debates.

End the "I always do the dishes" arguments. Track chores, see who's pulling their weight, and keep things fair.

Remember who paid for coffee last week. No more awkward "you owe me" conversations.

**Parenting made easier**  
Teach kids responsibility with chore tracking and rewards. They see what they've earned, you see what they've done.

**Team coordination**  
Rotate meeting notes, office cleanup, or client coverage. Everyone knows when it's their turn.
