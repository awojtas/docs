# Participant groups

Save groups of people and reuse them across activities. No more typing the same names repeatedly.

## Creating a group

Go to **Groups**, click **New Group**, name it (e.g., "Family", "Roommates"), add participants, and save.

## Using groups

When creating an activity, click **Add from Group** and select your group. Everyone is added instantly.

## Managing groups

Edit groups to add or remove people. Delete groups you don't need anymore. Deleting a group doesn't affect existing activities—participants stay where they were added.
