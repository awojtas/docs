# Rewards system

The rewards system lets you track money or points earned when participants complete their turns. Perfect for chore allowances, incentive programs, or gamifying household responsibilities.

## How it works

When rewards are enabled:
- Participants earn money or points each time they complete a turn
- Balances accumulate over time
- Activity owners can record payouts when rewards are redeemed
- Complete payout history is maintained for transparency

## Reward types

### Money
Track real currency (USD, NZD, AUD, GBP, etc.).

**Example**: Kids earn $2.50 each time they do the dishes.

### Points
Track a point system for gamification.

**Example**: Roommates earn 10 points per completed chore, redeemable for privileges.

## Setting up rewards

### For new activities

1. Click **New Activity**
2. Fill in the activity details
3. Enable **Rewards**
4. Choose reward type: **Money** or **Points**
5. Set the value per turn
6. For money, select the currency
7. Click **Create Activity**

### For existing activities

1. Open the activity
2. Click **Edit**
3. Enable **Rewards**
4. Configure the reward type and value
5. Click **Save**

<Note>
Enabling rewards on an existing activity starts tracking from that point forward. Previous turns do not earn rewards retroactively.
</Note>

## Viewing balances

Participant reward balances are displayed on the activity card:
- Current balance (unspent rewards)
- Total earned (lifetime)
- Total redeemed (lifetime payouts)

Click on a participant's balance to see detailed information and payout history.

## Recording payouts

Activity owners can record when rewards are paid out:

1. Click on a participant's reward balance
2. Click **Record Payout**
3. Enter the payout amount
4. Add an optional description (e.g., "Paid to savings account")
5. Click **Record**

The payout is deducted from the participant's balance and added to their payout history.

<Warning>
Payout amounts cannot exceed the participant's current balance.
</Warning>

## Payout history

View complete payout history for each participant:
- Date and time of payout
- Amount paid
- Description
- Who recorded the payout

This provides full transparency and accountability for the rewards system.

## Rewards with automatic rotation

Rewards work seamlessly with automatic rotation:
- When turns rotate automatically, rewards are awarded
- Participants earn rewards even if they don't manually click "Done"
- Turn history shows which rewards were earned automatically vs. manually

## Rewards and "Done by me"

When a participant uses "Done by me" to complete an activity outside their turn:
- They earn the reward for that completion
- The turn order continues normally
- This encourages participants to help out even when it's not their turn

## Excluding participants from rewards

Participants can be excluded from turn rotation while remaining in the activity:

1. Edit the activity
2. Find the participant
3. Toggle **Participating** off

Non-participating members:
- Don't appear in the turn rotation
- Don't earn rewards
- Can still view the activity
- Retain admin permissions if they had them

This is useful for parents or supervisors who manage the activity but don't participate.

## Best practices

- **Set fair values**: Ensure reward amounts are appropriate for the effort required
- **Regular payouts**: Record payouts regularly to keep balances manageable
- **Clear communication**: Explain the reward system to all participants
- **Track everything**: Use the payout description field to note how rewards were redeemed

## Currency formatting

Money rewards are automatically formatted based on the selected currency:
- USD: $2.50
- NZD: NZ$2.50
- AUD: A$2.50
- GBP: £2.50

Points are displayed as: "25 points"

## Disabling rewards

To disable rewards on an activity:

1. Edit the activity
2. Set reward type to **None**
3. Click **Save**

<Warning>
Disabling rewards does not delete existing balances or payout history. If you re-enable rewards later, previous balances will still be there.
