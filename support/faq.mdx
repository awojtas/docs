# Frequently asked questions

Quick answers to common questions.

## General

### What is Turnsies?

Turnsies tracks whose turn it is for shared activities. Stop arguing about who did what last.

### Is Turnsies free?

Yes.

### Do I need an account?

Yes. Accounts sync your activities across devices.

## Activities

### How many activities can I create?

Unlimited.

### Can I share activities with others?

Yes. Invite others via email. They accept and see the activity on their home screen.

### What happens if I delete an activity?

It's gone forever. All history deleted.

### Can I restore an archived activity?

Yes. Go to Archive, open the activity, and restore it.

## Participants

### What's the difference between local and invited participants?

**Local**: Names you type. Only you see them. No account needed.  
**Invited**: Registered users who get an email and can access the activity.

### Can I remove a participant?

Yes. Edit the activity and remove them. History is preserved. If you're a participant, use Leave Activity from the menu.

### How do participant groups work?

Save groups of people. Reuse them across activities. Create once, add with one click.

### What are admin permissions?

Admins can edit settings, manage participants, complete turns for others, and delete activities. Marked with a shield icon.

### Can I exclude someone from rotation without removing them?

Yes. Mark them as "not participating." They stay in the activity but don't appear in rotation or earn rewards.

## Turn tracking

### How does turn rotation work?

Turnsies supports two rotation modes:
- **Manual**: Participants manually mark turns as complete
- **Automatic**: Turns rotate automatically on a schedule (daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly)

### Can I skip someone's turn?

Yes, if skip rules allow it. Activities can be configured with three skip rule options:
- **Everyone**: Any participant can skip any turn
- **Own turns only**: Participants can only skip their own turns
- **No skips**: Skipping is disabled

### Can I undo a turn?

Yes, you can undo the most recent turn if it was completed within the last few minutes. Click the menu (three dots) and select **Undo**.

### What is "Done by me"?

If you complete an activity when it's not your turn, use "Done by me" from the menu. This records that you did the activity while keeping the turn order intact.

### How does automatic rotation work?

With automatic rotation, turns advance on a schedule without manual action. You can set activities to rotate daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly at a specific time. See the [Automatic rotation guide](/web/automatic-rotation) for details.

## Account

### How do I change my email?

Go to **Settings** → **Profile** → **Email** and update your email address. You'll need to verify the new email.

### How do I delete my account?

Go to **Settings** → **Account** → **Delete Account**. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

### Can I export my data?

Yes, go to **Settings** → **Data** → **Export Data**. You'll receive an email with a download link.

## Rewards

### How does the rewards system work?

You can configure activities to award money or points when participants complete turns. Balances accumulate over time, and activity owners can record payouts when rewards are redeemed. See the [Rewards guide](/web/rewards) for details.

### What currencies are supported?

Money rewards support USD, NZD, AUD, and GBP. Amounts are stored in cents/pence for precision.

### Can I change reward values after creating an activity?

Yes, you can edit the reward configuration at any time. Changes apply to future turns only—previous balances are not affected.

### What happens to rewards if I disable them?

Existing balances and payout history are preserved. If you re-enable rewards later, previous balances will still be there.

## Technical

### Does Turnsies work offline?

The web app requires an internet connection. The mobile app (coming soon) will cache activities for offline access, with changes syncing when you're back online.

### Why isn't my data syncing?

Check that:
- You're signed in to the same account on all devices
- You have an internet connection
- You're using the latest version of the app

Try signing out and back in if issues persist.
